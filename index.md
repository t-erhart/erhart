WELL - COMING:

Well, come in dear Ladies, Gentlethem and Gentlemen!
First of all, thank you for popping into my WEBSITE! 
This site is currently UNDER CONSTRUCTION …
So, it’s simple. 
You’ll find bits of information about me, future performances, workshops, other dates and an e-mail-address to contact me. If you’ve got questions about my current artistic and academic projects, want to invite me to one of yours and for any other inquiry, drop me an E-Mail.

Thank you very much!

My name is Tanja Erhart, I identify as a dis_abled cultural scientist, contemporary dancer and a human being of many. At the time I’m writing these lines I am sitting in my home office, windows wide open with sunshine and fresh air breezes coming through. Parts of my hair is moving with the breeze, while other parts are tied-up to a bun. I am wearing a moss-green two-piece outfit with two different textures woven together in a beehive pattern and a colourful pearl. Originally, I am from Tirol, my parents were born in Austria as well, I studied cultural- and social anthropology in Vienna, trained myself in contemporary dance throughout the world and am now based in London. My crutches are leaning next to me against the bedframe, they have signs of wear and tear, which makes the silver shine through the black paint of the metal. My wheelchair also shows some shiny silver marks, but CappuccinoLady as I call her, is in my chilli-red car, which I have parked just outside the flat. I live on the first floor, which is not accessible for me as a wheelchair user. But I am not one – I am many, and to be specific, I am three (luckily, because my mum says --- Everything good comes in threes!) So I come with three different corporealities – once with my wheelchair, once with my crutches and once without any access tools. I take my tools everywhere with me and have them close-by, so I can change my body depending on how I want to or need to move and express myself in the circumstance. Am I a luxury crip? Yes, No, Maybe! I am who I am and I work with what I’ve got. What life taught me so far, with all my visible and invisible disabilities is, that I am constantly changing and because of that, I am not one, but many. This means a balancing-act between action and resting, which can be challenging, but also is a big part of my well-being. Well, here we go – or even better – let’s move! I am particularly interested in moving with my three different bodies and collaborate with others.
