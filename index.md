![hello](/assets/hello.jpg)<br>


Well, come in dear LADIES, GENTLETHEM and GENTLEMEN!

![comein](/assets/comein.jpg)<br>
Thank you for popping into my HOMEpage! <br>

**ABOUT ME THREE:**<br>
My name is Tanja Erhart, I identify as a dis_abled cultural scientist, contemporary dancer and a human being of many. At the time I’m writing these lines I am sitting in my home office, windows wide open with sunshine and fresh air breezes. Parts of my hair is dancing with the breeze, while other parts are tied-up tight to a little bun. I am wearing a moss-green two-piece outfit with two different textures woven together in a beehive pattern and a colourful pearl bracelet from my niece Emilia. Originally, I am from Tirol / Austria, I studied cultural- and social anthropology in Vienna, trained myself in contemporary dance throughout the world and am now based in London.

My crutches are leaning next to me against the bedframe, they have signs of wear and tear, which makes not only the silver shine through the black paint of the metal, but also makes them wise and sexy. My wheelchair shows some shiny wisps of silver too, but CappuccinoLady, as I call her, is not with me right now, she is in my chilli-red car, which I have parked just outside the flat. I live on the first floor, which is not accessible for me as a wheelchair user. But I am not one – I am many, with and without my access tools. To be specific, I come with three different corporealities – with my wheelchair, with my crutches and without any access tools. I take them everywhere with me and have them close-by, so I can change how I want to or need to move depending on the circumstance.

Am I a luxury crip? Yes. No. Maybe! I am who I am. I work with what I’ve got while being aware of privilege and systematic structures of oppression and hierarchy in society. 

What is important for me is not to make any assumptions. About myselves, about yourselves and other people. When unsure on how to speak to me, ask. If you want to talk or write about me or anything I said/wrote, please use the term disabled – it is not a bad word, but a part of my identities. Please do not use handicapped or person with a disability. I use the pronouns she/her/hers and prefer not to be described as inspirational. If you wish to do so, please reflect first on why and if you do so to make yourself feel better, just don’t. Any other honest reflection on my artistic work, please feel free to do so. For respectful contact with each other also belongs that we don’t assume someone’s heritage, if someone identifies as disabled or not, how independent someone is – What does independency even mean? -, which access someone needs or which pronouns to use. If you are uncertain in any of these, find the dialogue and respect given boundaries. 
What life taught me so far, with all my visible and invisible disabilities is, that I am constantly changing and because of that, I am not one, but many. Having said that … What I’ve just written or believed in to be true today – physically, emotionally, mentally – might be totally different from yesterday or tomorrow. In my dance practice and life, I wish to create relaxed environments of honesty and integrity where we can be together, respectfully, open and sustainable. Access is love and I dare to care to dare. For disabled people especially!
If you’ve got questions about my current artistic and academic projects, want to collaborate or for any other inquiry, please drop me an E-Mail. 

With love always,<br>
Tanja
